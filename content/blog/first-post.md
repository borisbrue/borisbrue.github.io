Welcome to the blog. I will use this space to share progress on projects, small technical findings, and the occasional personal update.

## What to expect
- Short write-ups about things I build or learn
- Notes on tools and stacks I am trying out
- A few personal milestones along the way

Stay tuned; the next posts will dive into the projects that shaped this portfolio.
